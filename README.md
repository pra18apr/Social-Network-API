## Project Description

This project creates an API for a fictional social networking application, allowing users to share thoughts, have friend lists, and react to friends' thoughts. Users can also update a thought, delete a thought, delete a reaction, remove a friend, and delete their account, removing their associated thoughts and removing them from any friend lists they were on.

## Tools Used to Create This Project
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* Mongoose

## Installation and Usage

If you would like to view the code and use the API on your own computer, follow the steps below:

* Clone the repository to your computer
* From the project directory command line, type `npm install` to install the dependencies for this project (express, and mongoose)
* Type `npm start` to start the server
* When you see the notification that the server is connected on localhost:3001, you can open your tool of choice to test out the routes. I used Insomnia Core.
